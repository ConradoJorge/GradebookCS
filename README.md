# GradebookCS
Gradebook program to follow along with Pluralsight course "C# Fundamentals"

As well as a guide to learning C# this also serves as a way for me to learn how to use Github and attempt to use best practices.

Pluralsight course "C# Fundamentals" has been completed as of 01/16/21.
No new edits are planned to be made to this repo.
